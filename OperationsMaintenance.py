# This module shall represent the O&M process.
# It shall provide O&M cost on Farm/Turbine/Component level.
# It shall model failures and Turbine availability. based on failure rates
# It shall have some representation of of the maintenance process and scheduling/queying of maintenance tasks.

#interaction with other modules: 
    # it shall get define the operational status of the turbines based on ongoing maintenance tasks
    # interaction with windfarm controller
        # overwrite turbine sett points

# O&M cost calculation 
# this can probably be reused from WOMBAT
